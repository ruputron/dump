    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>Hello there, I was wondering when you would show up. Welcome to my quiet corner of the internet. I'm a human from planet earth and am commonly known as Rupu when I'm online. This site is really just an experiment and something for me to mess around with when I'm bored, so don't expect anything groundbreaking lol.

    <h2>Commodore C=64.</h2>
    <p>As you might have already noticed I'm a fan of the Commodore 64, a classic home computer from the 1980s that still has a strong following and userbase today. New games and software, music for the awesome 6581 and 8580 SID sound chips and demos that are made to really test the limitations of the aging C64 hardware.
    </p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;">
    <h2>CSDB.</h2>
    <p>Recent years have been interesting in the Commodore scene, I'm pretty new to it all really (apart from having a C64 Breadbin when I was at high school) but this stuff is really fascinating to me, people who know what they're doing with their programming skills making awesome stuff for the old C64, demoscene peeps doing stuff that's really impressive considering the tech limitations (C64 and a lot of old systems, probably all of them). Here's a linky if you, for whatever reason don't already know about this awesome site. <a href="https://csdb.dk/">CSDB</a> \o/

    <div class="column" style="background-color:#ddd;">
    <h2>Pixel Art.</h2>
    <p>I dabble in pixel art from time to time, as usual for me it's very sporadic and unproductive but I enjoy it when I do get around to it. Art in general is something I've had an interest in my whole life, music, writing, cinema, visual art.. It's all very inspiring and interesting to see the marks others have left in time.

    <h2>Contrast In Games.</h2>
    <p>I feel like it really adds a lot when a game has a good feeling of atmosphere and it's nice to break up the more intense parts of gameplay with some chill time. Resident Evil is probably the first example of this kind of thing I can think of. When games began using CD quality audio it was a big deal, it really made things feel more believeable and gave you a very different experience than the older sound chips we were used to at the time.

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#ddd;">
    <h2>Modern(ish) Tech.</h2>
    <p>I appreciate what some game devs and musicians have done with more modern tech. I often like to sit and relax in some of the more quiet areas of games these days listening to the ambient music or sounds. This kind of thing can massively improve my gaming experience and opinion of a game.

    <h2>Shitting On Our Own Doorstep.</h2>
    <p>The human race seem to be the masters of shitting on their own doorstep. The world we live in today is so full of piles of waste that we've made and have no way to dispose of it makes me think we forgot this planet is our home. What happened to the values of respecting the universe and the planet. It's the only one we've got for fucks sake.

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>Dying By The Thousands.</h2>
    <p>The world is mess and poised on the brink of complete destruction, people die by the thousands every day, some to war, some to disease others to bare stupidity. The one I really can't stand is the war, currently Gaza (Israel/Palastine), Ukraine, and many more places in thr world are ravaged by armed conflicts, see this wikipedia page<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts#Major_wars_(10,000_or_more_combat-related_deaths_in_current_or_previous_year)"> Ongoing Armed Conflicts</a>. All these wars need to be ended, I'm not a religious man but I know I'd pray for these to be ended and never return. Please, if you do one thing in your life, try to help resolve these rather than fuel the fire.
